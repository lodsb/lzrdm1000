Conceptional:
fuck dragging around mark inlets/outlets and press "c"

FIXMES:
fix wrong offset in doublepointverticalruler 0 in gview and scale are not the same!
fix refresh problem in gview!
interfaces for typhandler based and viewgeometry based stuff
***

improve speed when dragging node arround:
maybe setting the tab as parent for the node will fix the issues with having all the signal/slot mechanisms


Dev-Notes:

- resource handlers -> xml should have a facility to register on startup
- modular environment:
	pass static iterators for efficient playback&adaptive blocksizes?
	subpatches? how?
	
	dataflow based + state indicators (i.e. aimed for recording)
	
	side note: pull based signal processing? precaching?
	
- seqview: type based sequence lookup for quick routing in a side pane etc.

- central facility to manage/lookup all used sequences name and type based
- central facility for colorcoding based on types & objects used (sequences, conntections, etc)
- central system wide easy to use lookup/autocompletion facilities for:
	- quick routing
	- VALUERANGE lookup -> pattern sequencer stuff for known sequences
	- scripting
	

- playheads as timeline animation (qt) for constant updates regardless of the fps
