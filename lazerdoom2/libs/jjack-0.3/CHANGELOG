Version 0.3, 2007-12-30
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (JG)  added binary libjjack.jnilib for Mac OS, thanks to Stéphane Letz
- (JG)  updated documentation, web-site and readme-file
- (JG)  stripped version and date information from source-files in CVS
        (will be added to the archive's sources at build-time)
- (JG)  renamed 'Oscillator' to 'Oscilloscope'
- (JG)  old changelog information from Readme.txt moved to CHANGELOG,
        renamed Readme.txt to README, License.txt to LICENSE.
- (PJL) error messages if the native library cannot be loaded properly        
- (PJS) Relative basedir in build.xml
- (PJS) Use JAVA_HOME environment variable for ant build java dependencies. Example from shell: JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun ant all
- (PJS) All files created during the make process are now in .cvsignore
- (PJS) INF pointer type is now 64-bit (long) for AMD64 support
- (JG)  fix: auto-connecting output ports now works
- (JG)  added utility clients JJackPlayer and JJackRecorder in new package de.gulden.framework.jjack.util
- (JG)  added benchmark tool in de.gulden.framework.jjack.util.benchmark
- (PJS) ability to load native library from local lib folder (failover if libjjack.so not present in system library path)
- (PJS) Now can be launched as an Eclipse project
- (PJS) Added JJackQuickClientLaunch which lets you select the client to launch from a dropdown
- (PJS) New experimental JavaSound mixerprovider, for plugging javasound applications directly to jack (see com.petersalomonsen.jjack.javasound.JJackMixerProviderTest)
- (PJS) libjjack.c - fixed so that allocation of objects are done once and not for every process() call
- (PJS) Javasound mixerprovider support for inputs (TargetDataLines)
- (PJS) Eclipse compiler compliance level set to 1.4
- (PJS) ByteIntConverter for supporting various audioformats
- (PJS) Lines supports 8/16/24/32 bit big and little endian audio formats
- (PJS) Fixed Mixer and line support indication logic to comply with javasound
- (PJS) longFrame, microsecond, and frameposition implemented
- (PJS) DataLine.Info now outputs audioformat info, Mixer.Info, buffersize etc.
- (AC)  The size of the sample is found using size() rather than being hardcoded as 4
- (AC)  Some ints are cast to jsize which is long on 64 bit systems (see
        ftp://www6.software.ibm.com/software/developer/jdk/64bitporting/64BitJavaPortingGuide.pdf)
- (AC)  The allocation of inf->byteBufferArray[mode] is made outside the loop
        over ports. This avoids a null pointer exception in Java when there are
        zero ports (eg for output on a "consumer only" process).		

Version 0.2.1, 2006-12-02
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (JG)  streamlining of the build-process and completion of files in CVS:
        - distinguishing between project-build and distribution-build
        - inclusion of directories make, bin and doc into CVS
        Now all files needed to perform a full project-build are available via CVS, 
        including the ANT project-build script. The source codes have not changed
        since version 0.2.

Version 0.2, 2004-11-16
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (JG)  Most changes apply to libjjack.c, mainly the use of AttachCurrentThread() to
        enable Java-callbacks by the JACK thread. This implies:
        - no extra thread needed any longer to interact with the JACK thread,
        class JJackSystemThread has become obsolete and has been removed.
        - the pthreads-library is no longer needed by the native implementation, as no
        more semaphores are required for thread synchronization.
- (JG)  Some changes to class de.gulden.framework.jjack.JJackSystem, initialization
        will no longer start an internal processing thread.
- (JG)  Some enhancements to this readme-file.

Version 0.1, 2004-05-25
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (JG)  Initial release.
