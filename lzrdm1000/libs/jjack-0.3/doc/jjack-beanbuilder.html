<h2><a name="INSTALLING_THE_BEANBUILDER"></a>INSTALLING THE BEANBUILDER</h2>
<p>The <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/beanbuilder/index.jsp">BeanBuilder</a>
is a Java development tool by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun
Microsystems</a>. It can be downloaded
for free
at <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/beanbuilder/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/beanbuilder/index.jsp</a>.
As with most Java programs, no installation is necessary - just unpack
the files into their own directory and run the startup script <code>run.sh</code>
to test the BeanBuilder. The application will appear looking
like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_nojjack.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="450"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
Load the set of example JJack-clients from file <code>&lt;JJack-home&gt;/lib/jjack-clients.jar</code>,
by choosing "File / Load archive..." from the menu:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_loadjar.png" alt="" width="437"
 height="249"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
After the JJack clients have been loaded, a new sheet in the
BeanBuilder-toolbar appears:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_loadjar_palette.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="173"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
Now try to add a <code>Socket</code> client to the Bean
construction panel. Click the Socket-button in the toolbar (<img
 src="img/socket-small.png" alt="" width="26" height="6">),
then
click somewhere into the empty Bean-panel to place an instance of <code>Socket</code>
there. <i>The underlying native JJack system may crash at this point,
because
it gets initialized too late</i>. See
next chapter on how the BeanBuilder is run with support for JJack
clients.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="RUNNING_THE_BEANBUILDER_WITH_JJACK"></a>RUNNING THE
BEANBUILDER WITH JJACK SUPPORT<br>
</h2>
<p>This section describes how the BeanBuilder is started with
preconfigured
JJack support, having the example JJack-clients available in the
toolbar.</p>
<p>These points are to be taken care of:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The JJack API classes in archive <code>lib/jjack.jar</code>
must be present on the system classpath to be able to load JJack
clients inside the BeanBuilder (as seen above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent the application from crashing when the first JJack
Bean is instantiated, it is necessary on some systems to register the
native JACK client of the underlying JJack system as early as possible,
before actually starting up the BeanBuilder. This can be
achieved by using the JJackSystem wrapper, see <a
 href="#RUNNING_THE_BEANBUILDER_WITH_JJACK">Running
the BeanBuilder
with JJack support</a> for
details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>As a matter of convenience, the BeanBuilder can be pre-configured
with a toolbar that already contains the JJack example clients on
startup. This is done by passing a suitable "palette"-file as a
parameter and adding the JJack example clients in archive <code>lib/jjack-client.jar</code>
to the system classpath.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>JJack's distribution archive contains a startup script for the
BeanBuilder which takes care of these extensions. The script is <code>bin/runBeanBuilder.sh</code>.
Make sure all paths used in this script are set correctly (<code>JJACK_HOME</code>,
<code>BB_HOME</code> and <code>JAVA_HOME</code>), and that the JACK
daemon is running on your system. Then invoke <code>runBeanBuilder.sh</code>.
The application will start up with the JJack example clients available
on the toolbar:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_jjack.png" alt="" width="600" height="450"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
Again try to add a <code>Socket</code> client to the Bean
construction panel. The application should no longer crash.<br>
</p>
<h3>Connecting the native JACK client</h3>
<p>To find out if the native JACK client of the JJack system has
successfully been registered, start a JACK connection manager
application. (One of such applications is <code>qjackctl</code>, an
alternative tool is the command-line-controlled <code>jack_connect</code>.)
If everything works
fine, a JACK client named "JJack" appears in the list of available
clients:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/qjackctl.png" alt="" width="320" height="226"><br>
</p>
<p><br>
To test your JJack clients with audio data, connect JJack's input
ports to some audio source. The example below show the <code>xmms</code>
media player as input to JJack, and the system's 'physical' ALSA audio
output device fed by JJack's output:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/qjackctl_connected.png" alt="" width="320" height="155"><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="CONFIGURING_A_SINGLE_JJACK_CLIENT"></a>CONFIGURING A
SINGLE JJACK CLIENT</h2>
<p>After the native JJack client is registered and the BeanBuilder has
started up, you can start constructing a JJack client inside the
BeanBuilder.<br>
</p>
<p>1. First <b>pick the <code>Socket</code> Bean</b> and place it on
the
blank Bean-panel:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/socket_button.png" alt="Socket Bean button" width="162"
 height="95"><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_socket.png" alt="" width="600" height="450"><br>
</p>
<p>(A Socket client is always needed as the first element of a
Bean-built JJack client, because it provides access to the underlying
JJack system and lets the actual audio processor client connect to the
JJack system.)<br>
</p>
<p>2. Now <b>choose a JJack client from the
toolbar</b> palette by clicking its button, and place it onto the
Bean-panel. The example shows the <code>Gain</code> client put onto
the Bean-panel:</p>
<img src="img/beanbuilder_gain.png" alt="" width="600" height="450"><br>
<br>
<p>3. The last step is to <b>connect the client to the <code>Socket</code></b>,
in order to make the audio data 'flow' through the <code>Gain</code>
client (which means making the <code>process()</code>-method be called
regularly, subsequently delivering audio events). This is done by
drawing a
property connection from the <code>Gain</code> client to the <code>Socket</code><code>Gain</code>
client, and selecting the "<code>chained</code>"-property
of the <code>Socket</code> to be set:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_gain_connect1.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="450"><br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_gain_connect2.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="450"></p>
<p>(Note: The BeanBuilder does not support connecting Beans to each
other as event listeners, and without generating proxy classes. So the
way
to connect clients to each other is to set them
as each other's <i>properties</i>, not event listeners.)<br>
</p>
<p>The result is a a green arrow shown in design mode, that indicates
that the two beans are interconnected:</p>
<img src="img/beanbuilder_gain_connect3.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="450"><br>
<p>Finally, switch from design mode to runtime mode by unchecking the
checkbox "Design Mode" on the right:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_gain_connect4.png" alt="" width="600"
 height="450"><br>
</p>
<p>The JJack client Bean is now ready to use:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="img/beanbuilder_gain_bean.png"
 alt="Gain Bean in runtime mode" width="308" height="328"><br>
<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="USING_MULTIPLE_INTERCONNECTED_JJACK"></a>USING MULTIPLE
INTERCONNECTED JJACK CLIENTS</h2>
Multiple JJack clients can be put onto the Bean-panel and be
interconnected just the same way as described above with a single
client.<br>
<p>To let more than one client influence the audio signal stream,
connect another client to the previous one via the "<code>chained</code>"-property.
To let monitor-clients analyze the signal without changing it, connect
them via the "<code>monitor</code>"-property and its "<code>addMonitor(..)</code>"-method.</p>
The following example shows a chain of the <code>Gain</code> client
and the <code>Delay</code> client. Behind each client, an <code>Oscilloscope</code>
monitor-client is conected to display the signals:<br>
<p><img height="450" width="600" alt=""
 src="img/beanbuilder_interconnect.png"><br>
</p>
<p>Switching to runtime mode makes this JJack client Bean ready to use:<br>
